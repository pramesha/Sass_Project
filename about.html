            <p>
              Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins,
              Indiana, during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National
              Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United
              States Department of Energy, but secretly does experiments into
              the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve
              human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to
              an alternate dimension, "the Upside Down". The influence of the
              Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in
              calamitous ways.

            <p>
              The first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is
              abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce,
              and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the
              same time, a young psychokinetic girl called Eleven escapes from
              the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike, Dustin, and
              Lucas, in their own efforts to find Will.

            <h2 class="text-secondary">Second Season</h2>
            <p>
              The second season is set a year later, starting in October 1984.
              Will has been rescued, but few know of the details of the events.
              When it is discovered that Will is still being influenced by
              entities from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn there
              is a larger threat to their universe from the Upside Down.

            <h2 class="text-secondary">Third Season</h2>
            <p>
              The third season is set several months later, in the days leading
              up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt
              Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins' residents,
              putting most other stores out of business. Hopper becomes
              increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship while
              still trying to care for Joyce. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret
              Soviet laboratory under Starcourt seeks to open the gateway to the
              Upside Down, allowing the entities from the Upside Down to possess
              people in Hawkins and creating a new horror to deal with.
